Rust transliteration of Charles Petzold's Programming Windows 5th Edition ISBN-10 157231995X

The C source code has been manually converted into Rust and tested. There are twenty three chapters in total. Five have been completed so far (Jan 2018). My knowledge of Rust is slowly improving.

If you cannot understand what the code does then consider buying the book - the 5th edition is a classic and the last using C. It weighs 2.4kg (that's over 5lb).
